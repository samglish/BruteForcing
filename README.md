# BruteForcing
Brute force attack is a method used in cryptanalysis to find a password or key. It involves testing, one by one, all 
* possible combinations. 
* This method is generally considered the simplest conceivable.
* It allows any password to be broken in a finite time regardless of the protection used, but the time increases with the length of the password
* This method is often combined with dictionary and rainbow table attack to find the secret faster.
